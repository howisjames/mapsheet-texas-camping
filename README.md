# mapsheet-texas-campsites
Potential campgrounds for a family trip to Texas. Data came from the book by Wendel Withrow: *The Best in Tent Camping: Texas* guidebook.

Based on code from:
https://github.com/jsoma/mapsheet

This version of the resulting map displays the data as pop-ups from the pins and there is no color categorizing of the pins.

An alternate version color-codes the pins and uses a sidebar to display the information for each.
