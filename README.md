# mapsheet-texas-campsites
Potential campgrounds for a family trip to Texas. Data came from the book by Wendel Withrow: *The Best in Tent Camping: Texas* guidebook.

Based on code from:
https://github.com/jsoma/mapsheet

This version of the resulting map displays the data as pop-ups from the pins and there is no color categorizing of the pins. I did not end up using this version of the map in my personal blog because I've never been successful in applying the color-coded pins with this codebase.

An alternate version featuring color-coded pins and a sidebar to display the information for each point is what appears in my blog. This codebase utilizes https://github.com/carderne/leaflet-gsheets. Below is a link to my completed map.
